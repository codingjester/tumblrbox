This is just a total hack for using Dropbox and Tumblr together.

Basically start dropping files into your Tumblr App folder and it starts posting to your Tumblr.

Alot of this is hardcoded because I'm lazy but it's kind of cool right?

Anyway, you make files based on the different post types on Tumblr.
Eg: <filename>.<post_type>

Post Types

txt, text           - Just a simple text post. Whatever the contents are it posts it.
image files         - I just read this image files and post them to Tumblr (jpg, jpeg, gif, png)
youtube             - Post a youtube file :o
link                - A text file with a link in it.
soundcloud, spotify - Links to the audio urls in the file
quote               - Quotes that you want to post. The filename is going to be the source of the quote :D
chat                - a file with a chat conversation you've put together.

To run the tumblrbox, on some server which has access to your Dropbox just run:

ruby tumblrbox.rb

Then just start dropping files in.

This is all very brittle and is going to break on you. Sorry. It just will. :( BUT you should contribute and make it
NOT brittle and more user friendly! I wrote it in like an hour. This doc took longer ;)

Anyway, this was fun. I enjoyed it. It is not my finest code so please do no judge me on it. :D
